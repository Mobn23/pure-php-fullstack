## Project: Webtec Course Work (BTH)

This project was developed as part of the Web Technologies course at BTH.
The base structure was provided by the course material, and all application logic, design, and features were implemented by me during the course.

Original starter code from [BTH dbwebb repository](https://github.com/dbwebb-se/webtec.git) (public).


This is a pure PHP full-stack application with sqlite database (Two projects: proj & report).
